This project is dedicated to such task as stocks price forecasting.  
While research i noticed, that the most actual subject of study is comparison machine learning models and neural networks to classic models such as ARMA and ARIMA.  
But most of already existing works are devoted to the comparison of 2-5 in total.  
So, it doesn't allow forming single point of view without benchmarking different models by myself.  
In total i used 26 models such as autoregressive moving average, linear, decision tree and neural network based regression.  
I determined, that stacked GRU model provide the most accurate result.  
So, i used neural network with two GRU layers to get final model.  
Also, to be repeatable by anyone all code has been refactored and published like package in PyPI.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

### Built With
To prepare data were used such libraries as Pandas and NumPy.
To test different model were used libraries such as Statsmodels, Sklearn and Keras.
